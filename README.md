# APKDowngrader
And program to create and use downgrade/update files for apks

## How does it work?
It XORs the 2 apks to get the differences. Then it just XORs your apk with the downgrading file and you get a downgraded apk without ever doenloading it's code. For more info read [this wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) as it's based on One-time pads.
